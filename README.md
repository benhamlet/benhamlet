## About me :standing_man:

I am looking to change career and get my first tech role. I've opted to study CS50 to refresh my Computer Science knowledge and to attend a bootcamp delivering Full Stack Development training. This should build on my previous expereince.

My passion for tech began at an early age. I played around with a Commodore 64 and was hooked with programming. One that specifically sticks in my mind, was a ball which bounced around the monitor screen. I also programmed some simple games, given the tutorial book that came with the computer. In my teenage years, the internet came to our home. I began playing an early MMORPG called Ultima Online. I was hooked on the game and quickly found that there was a scene develpoing and running cusom servers. I spent many months teaching myself C/C++ to create my own systems and modifying how certain elements in the game ran. I hosted a successful server for just over a year. Along with any server, a webpage was essential. I learnt HTML and some Flash, to make a dynamic webpage for the time.

All through my adult life, I've kept up to date with tech and some programming. I've used ADB to jailbreak my phones and tweak settings. I've ahd a couple of Raspberry Pi projects and have become very good with automatic Excel spreadsheet processes using Visual Basic.

After school, I was unable to attend University and gave up on pursuing a career in tech. I began a career as a Heavy Vehicle Engineer. I've had a successful career and have been in Quality Control and management positions for the last 8 years but I've always wondered what could have been. Recently I made the decision to start training and to find a new job doing what I enjoy.
