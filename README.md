## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm transitioning into tech after a successful career in engineering and quality management. My passion for programming started young — experimenting with a Commodore 64 and later running my own custom server for *Ultima Online*, where I self-taught C/C++ and built websites using HTML and Flash.

Over the years, I’ve continued exploring tech through:
- Raspberry Pi projects
- Automating Excel workflows with Visual Basic
- Mobile device tweaking using ADB
- Building tools and problem-solving through code

Now, I’m diving deep into software development with a focus on **building full-stack applications**, and I’m actively seeking my first tech role.
